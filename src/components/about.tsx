        Hi there! <br />
        I am a Web3 full stack developer with 1.5 years of experience in
        building scalable, user-friendly interfaces using Typescript, React,
        Web3, Angular, and Node.
        <br />
        I am also completing a Math licentiate degree, which has sharpened my
        critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This blend of mathematical
        background and development expertise allows me to approach challenges
        from multiple angles and find creative solutions.
        <br />I thrive in collaborative team environments, continuously learning
        from my colleagues while delivering work of the highest standard
      </p>
